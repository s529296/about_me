I'm a junior majoring in Computer Science with a general emphasis. I have found very little that I do not like in Computer Science hence why I have not narrowed down to a specific emphasis. 

 

I grew up in Kearney, MO, a small rural town that is about 100 miles away from Maryville. In  high-school I didn't do much involving coding , but always found an interest in problem solving. Also, I wasn't really into sports besides golf, so I ended up getting into building computers and modding Xbox 360's. These hobbies ultimately led me to majoring in Computer Science.

 

After college I would love to do some sort of field-based software application. I have had offers to intern at everything from electrofishing companies to trucking companies, but really haven't found my true calling.  I need to get more internships before I graduate next spring, but I am very fortunate to make good money installing epoxy floors out of Kansas City. This has stalled me from interning more as I would make significantly less money, but has also helped introduce me to people with various businesses that I could possibly intern for.
